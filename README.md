# How to run this project

It uses Expo, so the steps are pretty much the same as any Expo project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install` in the root directory
3. Run `yarn start` in the root directory

### Notes from Tamagui
note because this is in a monorepo had to remove react, react-dom, and react-native-web deps and change metro.config.js a bit.
